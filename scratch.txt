Made for random notes to help me make this project

Objective:
    program will make a random password for user

    1. user can specify how long the password is
    2. user can say how many symbols they would like
    3. user can say how many numbers they would like


classes

utils: contains all the characters that can be used
tools: will contain functions
main: where program will be run from and user activity starts


function gen password:
parameters (total_password_len, symbol_len, number_len):
    new_password = []
    random_letters_len = total_password_len - (symbol_len + number_len)

    letters = password_gen_loop(total_password_len, character_type)
    symbol = password_gen_loop(symbol_len, character_type)
    numbers =password_gen_loop(number_len, character_type)

    append all to new_password

    rondom the whole array if possible

    return new_password


password_gen_loop(len, character_type):
    password = []
    for len in utils.character_type:
        password.append[random.choice(character_type)]
    return password
